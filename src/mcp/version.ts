/**
 * Resolved package version, computed once at module load.
 *
 * The version string is the rendezvous datum between cooperating daemon and
 * proxy processes: the daemon advertises its version in the hello line, and
 * the proxy refuses to share IPC across a mismatch (falls back to direct
 * mode), or replaces a daemon of an older release ({@link isOlderRelease}).
 * Keeping the resolution in one place avoids drift between the CLI
 * `--version` output (which reads `package.json` directly) and the daemon
 * handshake.
 *
 * Resolution strategy: read the bundled `package.json` two levels up from
 * this file — same relative position whether we're loaded from `src/mcp/` or
 * the `dist/mcp/` output, since `tsc` preserves the layout. If reading fails
 * (e.g. the package was unpacked oddly), fall back to "0.0.0-unknown" — a
 * sentinel that will never match a real version, so the proxy harmlessly
 * falls back to direct mode.
