/**
 * A Go type declared on its own lost its doc comment in both extractors:
 *
 *   // Foo is documented.
 *   type Foo struct{}
 *
 * tree-sitter-go wraps every type in a `type_declaration`, and the comment is
 * that declaration's previous sibling. The node is made from the spec inside
 * it (a `type_spec`, or a `type_alias` for `type A = B`), whose only
 * predecessor is the `type` keyword, so the docstring walk found nothing. A
 * type inside a `type ( … )` group kept its comment, which sits beside it in
 * the parentheses.
 *
 * A declaration holding one spec is now read from outside, as go doc reads
 * it. A group's leading comment stays the group's: it documents the group,
 * not its first member.
 *
 * Reading from outside the declaration exposed a gap Go functions already
 * had: a comment written after code on the line above (`const sides = 4 //
 * sides of a square.`) belongs to that line, not to the declaration below
 * it, and the docstring now starts after it.
 *
 * Runs against the native kernel (when built) and the wasm extractor, which
 * must agree.
